* **View Live Dashboard:** [Global Economic Risk & Volatility Analysis (1961–2023)](https://public.tableau.com/shared/S2W8FHBH9?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Project Summary
This project delivers a comprehensive, interactive dashboard analyzing global inflationary trends and economic volatility across 62 years of historical data (1961–2023) for over 190 countries.

The core objective was to move beyond simple inflation tracking by integrating and comparing two fundamental economic metrics: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the GDP Deflator. Key features include:

1) Data Integration: Successfully joined and standardized two distinct time-series datasets (inflation-consumer.csv and inflation-gdp.csv) to create a unified data model.

2) Outlier Detection: Utilizes an Average vs. Median CPI scatter plot to visually identify highly volatile economies that have experienced hyperinflationary events.

3) Dynamic Interactivity: Engineered cross-filter actions across all 5 core visuals (map, bar charts, time-series), enabling users to drill down into a single country's complete economic history for rapid risk diagnosis.
